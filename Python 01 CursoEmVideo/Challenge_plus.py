#O The exercise would just add two numbers.  

n1 = int(input('Write the first number: '))
n2 = int(input('Write the second number: '))
sum = n1+n2
sub = n1-n2
mult = n1*n2
div = n1/n2
print(' ')

print('The sum between {0} + {1} = {2}' .format(n1, n2, sum))
print('The subtraction between {} - {} = {}' .format(n1, n2, sub))
print('The multiplication between {} x {} = {}'.format(n1, n2, mult))
print('The division between {} รท {} = {}'.format(n1, n2, div))
